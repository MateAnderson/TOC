\noindent ``Printing Problem'': The problem to decide for every Turing machine M whether or not it will ever print some symbol (For Example $\Psi$) for input  $x$.\\
+In First step we use ``reduction technique''.\\
Simply we add one state after halting state that will print symbol $\Psi$ that is not exist in our output alphabet.Now our Problem is reduced to Halting Problem.\\
+In secong step we just need to show haltign problem is ``undecidable''.\\
Suppose we have one machine(equally an Algorithem) for Halting Problem named H.\\

Now if we take H as an input of H.py we will reach a contradiction.\\
So Haltig problem and also Printing Problem is undecidable.
